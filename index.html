        <h2>Data Collection and Visualization</h2>
        <body>
          This semester began with small data and the data collection. We had to think of something pertaining to our digital lives that we could track with data. I decided to track my use of the Line app; I thought it might be unique since not many people outside of Asia use it.
          I tracked how often I used it, who I spoke to, and what language I spoke in amongst other factors. It was interesting having to be aware of what I was doing online. After collecting the data, I had to create a
          visual display of it. I used cartoon cactus plants to display my data. I thought it would be cute, fun, and easy to understand.
          Although Inkscape was challenging to work with at times, I'm glad to have learned what I did about data visualization.

        <h2>Video Project</h2>
        <body>
          Group work is definitely not my strongsuit, but I still learned quite a lot about cryptocurrency. We had a nice mix in our group; Brittney is an economics student, Derek is in CS, and I'm an English major, so we had quite the range of backgrounds.
          All in all, I think we worked fairly cohesively. We looked into what ethical dilemmas surround cryptocurrency and condensed that information into a short video.
          Unfortunately the mp4 file for our video was too large to uplode here, but I am pleased with how it turned out.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <body>
          Overall, I think I learned quite a bit this semester about data and coding and the like. Although it was challenging at times, considering my difficulty with technology, but I think I pulled through alright.
          This website may not be the prettiest, but I built it myself with the knowledge I gained in this class.
